# What problem is docker solving?


- Docker is a platform that packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers, ensuring they run consistently across different environments.
- Docker solves the problem of replicating the same environment across different machines, which is a common issue in software development and deployment.

**Problem:**
Imagine you're a developer. You build an app on your laptop that uses:
- Python 3.11
- PostgreSQL 14
- Some third-party libraries

It runs perfectly on your machine. But when you:

- Give it to a teammate,
- Deploy it to a testing server, or
- Deploy it to production,
…it fails because:
The other environment uses Python 3.10,
Has a different library version,
Or is missing required system dependencies.

Docker packages your app with everything it needs to run — code, runtime, libraries, dependencies — into a container.
