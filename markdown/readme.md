## Single Backtics
- Used for inline code within a line of text.
- Useful for highlighting code snippets, commands, or variables that appear within sentences.
- Example: 
```markdown
To download, use the `curl` command.
```
- This will render as: 
    - To download, use the `curl` command.

## Tripple Backtics
- Used for multiline code blocks.
- Can include multiple lines of code, which is especially useful for longer snippets.
- Allows you to specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., bash, python, javascript).
- Example:
```javascript
const num1 = 3
const num2 = 4
console.log(3+4)
```

## Anchor Links
In Markdown, we can create links to headings within the same document by using anchor links. Most Markdown parsers (like those used in GitHub, GitLab, and many documentation tools) automatically create HTML-compatible anchors for headings.

### 1. Anchor Link Syntax
To link to a heading, enclose the heading name in parentheses, preceded by a # symbol. For example:
```markdown
[Link Text](#heading-text)
```

### 2. Formatting the Heading for the Link
- Markdown automatically converts headings to lowercase, replaces spaces with hyphens, and removes special characters.
- So, a heading like ## Example Heading would have an anchor link #example-heading.

#### Example
Suppose you have the following headings in your Markdown file:
```markdown
## Installation Guide
### Usage Instructions
```
We can link to these headings as follows:
```markdown
- [Go to Installation Guide](#installation-guide)
- [Go to Usage Instructions](#usage-instructions)
```
#### Notes
- If headings contain punctuation, some Markdown parsers may ignore it when creating the anchor (e.g., Hello! World becomes #hello-world).
- For GitHub specifically, we can preview the link by hovering over the heading in the rendered Markdown to see the anchor format.
