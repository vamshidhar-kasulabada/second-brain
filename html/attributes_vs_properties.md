In HTML, properties and attributes might seem interchangeable at first, but there are key distinctions:

**Attributes**

* **Part of the HTML Markup:** Attributes are defined within the HTML tag itself.
* **Initial State:** They primarily represent the *initial* state or configuration of an HTML element.
* **String Representation:** Attributes are always strings, even if they represent numerical or boolean values. 
* **Example:**
   ```html
   <input type="text" value="initial text">
   ```
   Here, `type` and `value` are attributes.

**Properties**

* **Represented in the DOM:**  Properties are part of the Document Object Model (DOM), which is the live representation of the HTML structure in the browser's memory.
* **Dynamic and Can Change:** Properties can be modified dynamically by JavaScript after the page has loaded, and these changes are reflected in the element's behavior and appearance.
* **Various Data Types:** Properties can hold different data types like strings, numbers, booleans, or even objects.
* **Accessed with JavaScript:** You interact with properties using JavaScript code.
* **Example:** 
   ```javascript
   const inputElement = document.querySelector('input');
   console.log(inputElement.value); // Accessing the 'value' property
   inputElement.value = "new text"; // Modifying the 'value' property
   ```

**Relationship**

- **Synchronization (Mostly):** When the browser parses your HTML, it creates corresponding properties in the DOM based on the attributes you've defined. For many standard attributes, changes to the property will also update the attribute (and vice-versa), but this is not always the case.
- **Some Exceptions:**  There are attributes like `value` for `<input>` elements where the property and attribute behave differently. The `value` property reflects the *current* value in the input field, while the `value` attribute stores the *initial* value.

**In Summary**

Think of attributes as the instructions you give in the HTML to set up an element, while properties represent the live, changeable state of that element within the browser as the user interacts with the page.
