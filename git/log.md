# Git log
The git log command is used to view the commit history of a Git repository. It shows a list of commits in reverse chronological order (most recent first), along with details such as the commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

Usage:
```bash
git log [options]
```

## `--oneline`
The --oneline option in the git log command simplifies the output by displaying each commit in a single line. It shows the commit hash (shortened) and the commit message, making it easier to view and understand a concise commit history.

```bash
git log --online
```
